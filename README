              I. Installation
           ---------------------		
  To install do:

1. ./configure [options]
  For the list of available options consult INSTALL file.
  The applications-specific options are:

  --enable-yydebug	         
     Enable parser debugging. The parser deugging can be useful to track down
  errors in configuration files such as /etc/raddb/users and /etc/raddb/config.
  To enable the debugging on a given file, the first line of it should contain
  the statement #debug starting on the first colon. Debugging output goes to
  stderr or to the file /var/log/radius.stderr if such file exists.

  --with-etcdir                  
     Specify the directory containing raddb files instead of the default 
  /etc/raddb.

  --with-auth-port=NUMBER	 
     Specify port number to use for authentication. Default is 1645. The
  default port number for accounting is computed as auth_port + 1.

  --enable-add-libs=STRING 	 
     Specify any additional libraries/libpaths your system might require.

  --enable-add-includes=STRING   
     Specify any additional include files/include paths.
 
  --enable-shadow	         
     Enable shadow support. Use this only if ./configure was unable to 
  correctly determine if it should use the shadow support.

  --enable-pam		         
     Enable pam support.

  --enable-dbm[={dbm|ndbm}]      
     Enable dbm support. If no argument is specified, an usual DBM is enabled.
  The `ndbm' argument instructs to enable support of NDBM.

  --ensble-mysql                 
     Enable mysql support. If an argument is specified it is supposed to 
  mean the default port to connect to. The port can be overridden in
  /etc/raddb/sqlserver.

  --enable-snmp                  
     Enable SNMP support.

  --enable-notify	         
     Enable TTL notification. This can be used to set the per-user session
  timeouts depending on their accounts.

  --enable-livingston-menus	 
     Enable support for Livingston-compatible menus.

  --enable-deny-shell=SHELL
     Always reject users with given shell.

  --enable-attrib-nmc	         
     Enable vendor-specific attributes (ATTRIB_NMC) keyword in dictionaries.

  --enable-osfc2	          
     Enable OSFC2 support.

     The following is designed for future use. Currently the norwegian locale
  (bokmal) is being finished.

  --enable-nls		         
     Enable national language support. 

  --with-languages=LIST          
     Set a list of languages to include in NLS.

  --with-catobjext=EXT          
     Override default .po extension.

  --with-instobjext=EXT          
     Override default .mo extension.

  --with-msgfmt=PROG             
     Use PROG instead of msgfmt.

  --with-gnu-msgfmt=PROG         
     Use PROG instead of GNU msgfmt.

2. make
3. make install


              II. Some configuration issues:
           ------------------------------------		

  Files raddb/users raddb/hints and raddb/huntgroups all follow the same
syntax:

input       : username check_pairs reply_pairs
	    ;

check_pairs : pairs
            ;

reply_pairs : pairs
            ;

pairs       : NULL
            | pairlist
            ;

pairlist    : pair
            | pairlist ',' pair
            ;

pair        : attribute op value
            ;

op          : '=' | '!=' | '<' | '>' | '<=' | '>='
            ;

value       : NUMBER
            | IPADDR
            | DATE
            | QUOTE
            ;

username    : STRING
            ;

attribute   : STRING
            ;

  Terminal symbols are as follows:
STRING   is a character string consisting of alphanumeric characters,
         underscore, dash and a dot. Note that it is not required to
         start with an alphabetic character.
NUMBER   is any decimal number.
IPADDR   is either a hostname or an IP address in dotted quad notation.
         When a hostname is specified it must be enclosed in a pair of
         double quotes, e.g. "host.dom.ain". An IP address may be specified
         either as is, or in a pair of double quotes.
DATE     date in a form:
		"Mon DM YEAR"
	 where
		Mon  is a three-letter abbreviation of a month name
		DM   is a two-digit day-of-month number
		YEAR is a full year number. 
QUOTE    is any character string enclosed in a pair of double-quotes.
NULL     is a word NULL, meaning empty pairlist.

  Special usernames DEFAULT and DEFAULT%d, where %d means any decimal number,
are reserved. When authenticating a request, radius first tries to find
the exact match on username and check_pairs. If such a match cannot be found
it tries to find a DEFAULT entry matching the check_pairs. All DEFAULT
entries are tried in the order of their appearance in the file.
  When compairing pairlists, order of pairs is not significant. Special
attributes (the ones with number > 254) appearing in a pairlist are ignored.

              III. Special hacks for some peculiar NASes		
           ------------------------------------------------

GNU Radius includes packet rewriting support which makes it possible
to cope with some NASes which do not follow the protocol. The support
for following NASes is already included:

	1. MAX Ascend which sends packed NAS-Port-Id attributes
	2. Specialix Jetstream with peculiarities in handling
           usernames longer than 10 characters.
	3. Cisco AS5300	used for VoIP.

Support for another NASes can easily be added without recompiling Radius. 
See accompanying documentation (Ref. "rewrite").

		IV. Bug reporting.		
           ------------------------------------------------

Bug reports are velcome. Should you find any bugs please report them 
to bug-gnu-radius@gnu.org.
